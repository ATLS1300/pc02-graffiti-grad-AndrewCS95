# Create a panel to draw on. 
panel = Screen()
w = 750 # width of panel
h = 750 # height of panel
panel.setup(width=w, height=h) #600 x 600 is a decent size to work on. 
#You can experiment by making it the size of your screen or super tiny!

# Create a colorful background and add Bezos image to it
image = "Bezos.gif"
panel.bgcolor("lightsteelblue1")
panel.bgpic(image)

#=======Add your code here======
#To Jeff Bezos' picture, add at least 2 different geometric shapes - 
# this could be a circle, a polygon (+4 sides), and/or a line.

#FOR FULL CREDIT, these shapes must:
#1. have different weights (or thicknesses) of the lines
#2. be drawn at different positions on the screen (you can use goto(x,y) for a specific position, or pick up the pen up() and use forward() and turns (left(), right()) to navigate your turtle)

#EXTRA CREDIT
#0.5 pts - create a 3rd shape
#0.5 pts - set at least one color using RGB values.
#0.5 pts - create one unfilled and one filled shape
